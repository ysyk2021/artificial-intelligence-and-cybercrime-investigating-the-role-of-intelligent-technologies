The purpose of this book is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in preventing and combating cybercrime. AI has become an increasingly powerful tool for detecting and responding to cyber attacks, and has the potential to transform the field of cybersecurity.

In this book, we will provide an overview of AI and its applications in cybersecurity, examine the ways in which AI can be used to prevent and respond to cybercrime, and discuss the ethical implications of using AI in this context.

We will also explore case studies and real-world examples of how AI has been used to prevent or respond to cyber attacks. Through these examples, we hope to demonstrate the potential of AI in the fight against cybercrime.

The intended audience for this book is broad and includes students, academics, researchers, practitioners in the field of cybersecurity, and anyone interested in the intersection of AI and cybercrime. We hope that readers will come away from this book with a deeper understanding of how AI can be leveraged for improving cybersecurity, as well as an appreciation for the potential risks and challenges associated with using intelligent technologies in this context.
